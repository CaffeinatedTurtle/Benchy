This directory is intended for PlatformIO Test Runner and project tests.

Unit Testing is a software testing method by which individual units of
source code, sets of one or more MCU program modules together with associated
control data, usage procedures, and operating procedures, are tested to
determine whether they are fit for use. Unit testing finds problems early
in the development cycle.

Changing the Throttle Mode:
Set the transmitter's throttle to the maximum position.
Connect the ESC to power.
The ESC will begin by emitting a single beep via the motor, followed by a brief pause. It will then incrementally produce more beeps, with a short pause between each set of beeps.
Wait for the ESC to emit three beeps.
Before the ESC emits four beeps, move the throttle to the minimum position.
The ESC will repeatedly alternate between emitting one and two beeps, with a brief pause in between. To activate the desired throttle type, follow the instructions below:
Uni-directional Mode: Wait for the ESC to emit ONE beep, then proceed to the next step.
Bi-directional Mode: Wait for the ESC to emit TWO beeps, then proceed to the next step.
Set the throttle to the minimum position.
After a few seconds, the motor will produce four rapid alternating beeps to confirm that the throttle type has been saved.
Power off the ESC.
The Throttle Mode has been saved. Next continue to Step 2: Throttle Calibration Procedureâ€‹ to help ensure the smoothest throttle operation.

*Note: Ensure a motor is connected to hear the beeps, as the ESC generates sound through the motor.
